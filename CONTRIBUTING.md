## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs

If you find any bugs or issues, please submit a detailed report by following these steps:

   - The steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The expected and actual results.
   - Any error messages, screenshots, or logs that could help.
   - Your environment (e.g., Python version, OS).

### 2. Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement:
1. Check if it has already been requested in the [issues](https://github.com/bichitra07/ugc_net_answerkey_checker/issues).
2. If not, open a new feature request issue with:
   - A clear description of the feature.
   - Why you think the feature would be beneficial.
   - How it could be implemented (if you have ideas).

   ```

#### 3.2 Write Clean and Documented Code

- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines for Python code style.
- Write clear, concise, and self-explanatory code.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of any complex logic.
- If you add or change functionality, ensure that it is well-documented in the code and in the `README.md` if necessary.

#### 3.3 Test Your Code

Make sure that your changes don’t break existing functionality. If possible, add unit tests for your changes:
